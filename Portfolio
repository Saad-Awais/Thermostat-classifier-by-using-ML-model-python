Portfolio: Classifying Thermostats Using Machine Learning

1. Project Overview

Project Title:
Classifying Thermostats Using Machine Learning

Abstract:
This project aims to build a robust machine learning pipeline that evaluates thermostat performance by classifying them as accurate or inaccurate. Accuracy is determined based on two key metrics: temperature deviation and response time. By leveraging data science techniques and Python libraries, the project develops an end-to-end solution—from data acquisition and preprocessing to model training and evaluation—all implemented within a Google Colab environment for reproducibility and collaboration.

Objectives:

Develop a binary classifier to differentiate between accurately and inaccurately performing thermostats.

Enhance energy efficiency and occupant comfort by identifying devices that deviate from performance standards.

Demonstrate proficiency in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using Python and machine learning libraries.

2. Background & Motivation

Thermostats are critical components in HVAC systems, impacting both energy consumption and comfort levels. Even minor deviations in temperature measurement or slow response times can lead to inefficiencies and increased operational costs. This project focuses on automating the detection of such performance issues through a systematic machine learning approach, ensuring rapid identification of malfunctioning units in a scalable way.

3. Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python
Environment: Google Colab (cloud-based, free GPU/TPU support, and collaborative features)
Libraries & Frameworks:

pandas: For data ingestion, cleaning, and manipulation.

4. Methodology & Workflow

The project follows a structured approach comprising the following phases:

4.1 Data Acquisition and Initial Exploration

Data Source:
The dataset is provided as an Excel file containing readings such as actual temperature, measured temperature, temperature deviation, and response time.

Steps:

Import necessary libraries (pandas, numpy).

Load the dataset using pd.read_excel().

Inspect the data using df.head() to confirm the integrity of imported columns and identify any anomalies.



4.2 Data Preprocessing and Label Engineering

Objective:
Prepare the data for model training by cleaning and engineering a binary label based on the following criteria:

Accurate (Label 1): Temperature Deviation ≤ 2°C and Response Time ≤ 2 seconds.

Inaccurate (Label 0): Any violation of the above conditions.


Steps:

Utilize np.where() to create a binary label for each record.

Clean the data by removing rows with missing values in critical columns to maintain consistency.

Separate the data into features (Temperature Deviation, Response Time) and the target variable (Label).



4.3 Model Training Using Random Forest

Model Choice:
A Random Forest classifier is selected for its robustness, ease of handling non-linear data, and resistance to overfitting.

Steps:

Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets using train_test_split().

Initialize the RandomForestClassifier with a fixed random state to ensure reproducibility.

Train the model using the training data (clf.fit()).



4.4 Model Evaluation and Interpretation

Evaluation Metrics:

Precision: How many of the predicted positives are actually positive.

Recall: How many of the actual positives were correctly predicted.

F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.


Steps:

Generate predictions on the test set.

Use classification_report from scikit-learn to obtain a detailed performance analysis.

Interpret the results to understand model strengths and areas for improvement.

6. Challenges and Solutions

Data Quality Issues:
Initial datasets may contain missing or inconsistent values.
Solution: Implementing robust data cleaning procedures to remove or impute missing values ensured model integrity.

Model Generalization:
