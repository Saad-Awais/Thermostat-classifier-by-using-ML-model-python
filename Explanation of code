Explanation

Data Loading and Inspection:
The code reads the Excel file and prints a sample of the data so you can confirm column names and types.

Feature Selection:
It uses “temperature_deviation” and “response_time” as the input features. The target column (assumed to be named "label") indicates if a thermostat is accurate or inaccurate.

Data Visualization:
A scatter plot is provided to help visualize the relationship between the two features and the target.

Train-Test Split:
The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Model Training:
Two models are trained:

1. Logistic Regression – a baseline linear classifier.


2. Decision Tree – along with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the best tree parameters.



Evaluation:
Both models are evaluated with a confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score.

Optional Visualization:
If you have Graphviz installed, the decision tree is exported and rendered for visualization.


This code provides a framework to classify thermostat performance. Adjust the code based on your data’s specifics or additional features if needed.
